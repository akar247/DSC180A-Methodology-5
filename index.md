## Questions:

<br>

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
      - I think the most interesting topic we covered in our domain this quarter was the various models (especially LLMs) we looked at to optimize our transaction memo categorization task. I also really liked learning more about the credit and banking industry, as well as the overall development process for these types of data science applications. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
      - The goal for our Quarter 2 project is to classify consumers' scores better, or the likelihood of defaulting on a loan, as an improvement on the credit score metric. In this way, we can reduce a bank's loss on defaulted loans by optimizing their choice in customers who are credible enough to receive a loan. 

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
      - 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
