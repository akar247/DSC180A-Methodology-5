## Questions:

<br>

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** 

I think the most interesting topic we covered in our domain this quarter was the various models (especially LLMs) we looked at to optimize our transaction memo categorization task. I also really liked learning more about the credit and banking industry and the overall development process for these types of data science applications. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

The goal for our Quarter 2 project is to classify consumers' scores better, or the likelihood of defaulting on a loan, as an improvement on the credit score metric. In this way, we can reduce a bank's loss on defaulted loans by optimizing their choice of customers who are credible enough to receive a loan. 

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I'd make is simplifying my work and modeling techniques to get a working version and then moving to add complexity to optimize our model. This quarter I struggled with kernel and training issues because I tried to optimize the model before having a working version. I think this would be a huge improvement in my development process and how I approach the Quarter 2 Project. 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would be interested in working with the same modeling technique in a regression context. Currently, we work a lot with classification modeling techniques and structure our accuracy metrics on what fits best for classification tasks. I would like to be exposed to the translated techniques and metrics that are best used to evaluate regression modeling tasks to have a more holistic understanding of how modeling works with real-world projects.
